A cross-language framework that allows you to code your scripts and EAs only once and use it on both MT4 &amp; MT5. <br>

```cpp
#include <Just_MQL_Framework/main.mqh>
```
3. Just enjoy!

### Notes

### Optional Libraries
These libraries are not required to use the built-in MQL functions, however, it has some useful classes and methods that can help you to solve problems solved by us and other external libraries added to the framework. <br>
If you do NOT want to load these files into your project, go to the file `main.mqh` and delete the line `#define INCLUDE_LIBRARIES`. With that all this optional libraries will not be included in your project. <br>

List:
- [CChart](https://github.com/justupcorp/Just_MQL_Framework/wiki/CChart) - To handle chart, and some useful chart objects like a logo, and a debug button during your development.
- [CWebRequests](https://github.com/justupcorp/Just_MQL_Framework/wiki/CWebRequests) - To handle content on the web (currently supports discord and telegram message and media sending)

_Please, be patient, some other libraries are already coded and being adapted to the framework, so will be at least an update daily with more libraries._ <br>
