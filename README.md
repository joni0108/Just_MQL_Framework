# Just MQL Framework v3
This is a new version of this framework, however more than an update for the current v2, it is a remake of this framework. <br>
If you are new to this repository while there's not any official v3 release of the repository, please stick to the version 2 which will be up to date and ignore this branch. <br>
Developing this version doesn't mean that the v2 will not receive any further updates. `All the new libraries will be included in the version 2` while this do not have an official release. <br>
See the [release notes](Release%20Notes.md) for a most detailed information about the `version 3`.

## Folders Structure
- `libraries` - This folder contains all the `DLL` libraries that must be copied to your `/libraries` folder in your MQL4 and MQL5 folder.
- `source` - In this folder are all the libraries that have the `.mqh` extensions. Inside this folder are all the libraries structured in sub-folders.
- `resources` - This folder contains all the resources that some libraries use. Usually Bit-map images for buttons and dialogs.
- `docs` - The documentation main folder.
- `errors` - This is a kind of libraries folder that include all the MQL and internal errors. It is not inside the source folder due that all the libraries depends on this folder fot debugging.
- `logs` - In this folder will be generated all the logs files of the framework. When an error is detected in the framework, this error will be added to the logs files of that specific day.
- `modules` - In this folder are files for the importing process of the structured source code and libraries.

### `Hidden` Folders
The folders that start with the `.`<name> must be ignored. This are usually folders generated by github, git, visual studio, or folders where I store all the templates I use in the repository.

# Framework Modules
This framework version will be divided in modules that can be included by themself. <br>
For including a module use:
```cpp
#include <Just_MQL_Framework/modules/<module_name>.mqh>
```
You will be able to include more than a module by adding their importation line. <br>
If you want, you can also include one or more sub-module instead of including the whole module, for doing that you can use:
```cpp
#include <Just_MQL_Framework/modules/<module_name>/<sub-module_name>.mqh>
```

### Example
In the following example we include from the module `Main` the `ticks` sub-module, and then below include the whole main module.

```cpp
//--- Including just the ticks sub-module from the main module
#include <Just_MQL_Framework/modules/main/ticks.mqh>

//--- Including the whole main module
#include <Just_MQL_Framework/modules/main.mqh>
```
